<h1 style="color:blue; text-align:center">Our Mission</h1></br>
<h3 style="color:white">With our motto of "Get off the couch, run the track", The First Annual Exeter Summer Athletic Meet was an event with its mission to promote a healthy lifestyle for the members of the Exeter Summer community as well as provide the Track athletes with an opportunity to compete in their own sport (Track is not offered as a sport option at Exeter Summer). However, The Athletic Meet was more than just having the athletes run on the track - we have also included the fun activities such as Soccer and Capture The Flag games on the field of the track.</h3></br></br>
