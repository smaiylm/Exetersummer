# Exetersummer

I self-taught Web Development/HTML/Web Hosting since 2011 (age 9), and Smaiyl.com was one of my first few websites I ever coded with HTML and CSS (in 2013, at age 11). I also used part of smaiyl.com as the website for The First Annual Exeter Summer Athletic Meet event I spearheaded, organized, and promoted as part of The Charles J. Hamm '55 Leadership Program at Phillips Exeter Academy over the summer of 2017. The files and the web pages can be found in the “exetersummer” folder. 

All .html pages also have corresponding .txt files (to allow easier viewing of the code).
